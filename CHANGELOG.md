## [0.7.7] — 2026-05-21

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Polkit rule is now mandatory** — installation aborts if the polkit rule cannot be written
- **Polkit rule always overwrites** — no skip, no "already exists" check, always installs
- **`hypridle` added as required dependency** in PKGBUILD

### Fixes

- Screen turning off during inhibit: `hypridle` was not running
- Polkit rule not installed: was conditional (`if [ ! -f ... ]`), now always installs
- `hyprcaffeine.install` (`post_install`): removed existence check — always overwrites
- `install.sh`: if polkit fails → `return 1` with clear manual install instructions
- `install.sh`: inline generation fallback when no template is available
- `install.sh`: multiple `sudo` approaches (`tee` + `cp`) for broader compatibility
- `install.sh`: `hypridle` runtime dependency check (warns if missing)

### Tests

- 55/55 unit tests PASS
- 7/7 functional tests PASS (NUC + ASUS)
  - `on infinite` → inhibit SLEEP
  - `monitor on` → inhibit IDLE
  - `lid on` → inhibit HANDLE-LID-SWITCH
  - `off` → preserves monitor + lid
  - `on 5m` (timer) → countdown correct
  - `off --all` → everything clean
